# CSS variable
 Contain specific values to be reused throughout a document. They are set using custom property notation (e.g., --main-color: black;) and 
 are accessed using the var() function (e.g., color: var(--main-color);).
 
 In Code example , we have used variable to have variation in animation among different components.
