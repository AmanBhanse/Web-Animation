# Easing
Describes the changes in speed of your animation over the time

Linear: distance traveled is linear (no acceleration)
Ease-in : start slow then go fast (acceleration)
Ease-out: Starts fast then go slow (deceleration)
Ease-in-out : Accelerate then decelerate
Ease : Some kind of Acceleration then deceleration but different than Ease-in-out
